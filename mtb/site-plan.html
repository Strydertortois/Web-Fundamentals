      <h3>Trail Difficulties</h3>
      <p>
        Green or "Beginner" Trail
        <br><br>
        This type of trail is recommended for beginners and is where we would recommend taking your first ride on! 
        Green trails are smooth, slow moving, and the perfect start for all beginner riders!
        Even more experienced riders can have fun on green trails and many enjoy riding them to warm up for harder trails.
        Green trails are also perfect for a nice family ride or if you want to appreciate the nature around you. 
        Green trails dont normaly have any technical terrain making them perfect for beginners! 
        <br><br>Blue or "Intermidiate" Trail
        <br><br>The Blue trail is a step above the green trail and is best suited for riders with slightly more experience. 
        Blue trails can be either flowy, technical, or a combination of both, creating an awesome riding experience!
        We wouldnt recommend riding a blue trail until you feel confident riding green trails and are ready to step it up a notch. 
        Many consider blue trails to be the "sweet spot" because they are usually faster and a little bit more difficult than green trails
        but arnt overly difficult.
        <br><br>Black Diamond or "Advanced" Trail
        <br><br>The Black diamond trail will test your ability as a mountain bike rider and should only be attempted after you are highly experienced 
        as a rider and feel extremely comfortable on all types of blue trails. Black diamond trails will have steep, technical, gnarly terrain  
        with big jumps and drops. Black diamond trails can be extremely fun and rewarding, but are generally very difficult and will put all of your biking 
        experience to the test. Some black diamond trails will have manmade features to add more variety and fun to the trail and many of the harder sections 
        can be avoided with a optional routes. Caution and care is needed to avoid serious injury on these trails.
        <br><br>
        Double Black Diamond or "Most Advanced" Trail
        <br><br> Double Black Diamond trails are for the most advanced and experienced riders. Years of experience and practice is required 
        to complete this trail type. Double black diamond trails contain massive unavoidable man made features, drops, gap jumps, and steep cliff faces.
        Extreme caution should be taken when riding these type of trails and extra protection and gear is recommended. Many professional level mountain bikers 
        struggle to complete some double black diamond trails becasue they are intentionaly built to test even the most experienced riders.

      <h3>Trail Types</h3>
      <p>
        Please read your trails "trail map" before riding. There are many different attributes that are unique to different trails and bike park so 
        its important to read them before riding. 
        <br><br>
        The two main trail types are "Flow" and "technical" trails. 
        <br><br>
        Flow Trail
        <br><br>
        Flow trails are exactly what the name says, "flowy". Flow trails are usually fast, smooth and have lots of jumps. 
        Flow trails are best if you are looking for speed and airtime on your bike. The speed, steepness, and size of the jumps usually depends
        on the difficulty rating of the trail. 
        <br><br>
        Technical Trail
        <br><br>
        Technical trails are usually slower and are meant to test the riders control and ability to manouver the bike. 
        They consist of rocky, steep and rutty terrain with a focus on control rather than speed. Just like flow trails, 
        the amount of steep features and technical sections depends on the difficulty rating on the trail. Green trails typicaly 
        arnt classified as technical. 
        <br><br>
        There are many other trail attrbutes such as "downhill only","connector trail","singletrack","fireroad" and they all vary based
        on the trail system you are riding in. This is why its important to read the trail map as they will usually have a key that will tell
        you what the terms mean because they vary from system to system.
