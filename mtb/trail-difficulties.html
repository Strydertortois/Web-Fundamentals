                <p> This type of trail is recommended for beginners and is where we would recommend taking your first ride on! 
                    Green trails are smooth, slow moving, and the perfect start for all beginner riders!
                    Even more experienced riders can have fun on green trails and many enjoy riding them to warm up for harder trails.
                    Green trails are also perfect for a nice family ride or if you want to appreciate the nature around you. 
                    Green trails dont normaly have any technical terrain making them perfect for beginners!</p>

                </div>
                <p>The Blue trail is a step above the green trail and is best suited for riders with slightly more experience. 
                    Blue trails can be either flowy, technical, or a combination of both, creating an awesome riding experience!
                    We wouldnt recommend riding a blue trail until you feel confident riding green trails and are ready to step it up a notch. 
                    Many consider blue trails to be the "sweet spot" because they are usually faster and a little bit more difficult than green trails
                    but arnt overly difficult.</p>

                <p>The Black diamond trail will test your ability as a mountain bike rider and should only be attempted after you are highly experienced 
                    as a rider and feel extremely comfortable on all types of blue trails. Black diamond trails will have steep, technical, gnarly terrain  
                    with big jumps and drops. Black diamond trails can be extremely fun and rewarding, but are generally very difficult and will put all of your biking 
                    experience to the test. Some black diamond trails will have manmade features to add more variety and fun to the trail and many of the harder sections 
                    can be avoided with a optional routes. Caution and care is needed to avoid serious injury on these trails.</p>

                <p>Double Black Diamond trails are for the most advanced and experienced riders. Years of experience and practice is required 
                    to complete this trail type. Double black diamond trails contain massive unavoidable man made features, drops, gap jumps, and steep cliff faces.
                    Extreme caution should be taken when riding these type of trails and extra protection and gear is recommended. Many professional level mountain bikers 
                    struggle to complete some double black diamond trails becasue they are intentionaly built to test even the most experienced riders.</p>
