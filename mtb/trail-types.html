                    <h2>Flow Trail</h2>

                <p> Flow trails are exactly what the name says, "flowy". Flow trails are usually fast, smooth and have lots of jumps. 
                    Flow trails are best if you are looking for speed and airtime on your bike. The speed, steepness, and size of the jumps usually depends
                    on the difficulty rating of the trail. Flow Trails take mountain bikers on a terrain-induced roller coaster experience, with little pedaling and braking necessary. This style of trail typically contains features like banked turns, rolling terrain, various types of jumps, and consistent and predictable surfaces.
                    Flow trails deliver fun to riders regardless of what kind of bike they own. You can have a blast riding a flow trail whether you are on a budget hardtail or a high-end carbon fiber trail bike.
                    The lack of steep climbs and descents, along with smooth surfaces, levels the playing field. A good set of lungs and legs, as well as the proper balance and control, are more valuable than a fancy bike when riding flow.</p>

                    <h2>Technical Trail</h2>
                    <img class="tech-trail-img" src="images/Page 3 Tech Trail.jpg" alt="Technical Trail Image">
                </div>
                <p>Technical trails are usually slower and are meant to test the riders control and ability to manouver the bike. 
                    They consist of rocky, steep and rutty terrain with a focus on control rather than speed. Just like flow trails, 
                    the amount of steep features and technical sections depends on the difficulty rating on the trail. Green trails typicaly 
                    arnt classified as technical. Harder technical trails will require more expensive protection equipment such as a full face helmet and pads. 
                A more expensive bike will also improve your experience on technical trails. More expereince is generally recommended when riding these types of trials because the require more precise and focused movements that come with years of biking.

                <p>There are many other trail attrbutes such as "downhill only","connector trail","singletrack","fireroad" and they all vary based
                    on the trail system you are riding in. This is why its important to read the trail map as they will usually have a key that will tell
                    you what the terms mean because they vary from system to system.</p>
