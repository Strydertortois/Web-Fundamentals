                <p> Flow trails are exactly what the name says, "flowy". Flow trails are usually fast, smooth and have lots of jumps. 
                    Flow trails are best if you are looking for speed and airtime on your bike. The speed, steepness, and size of the jumps usually depends
                    on the difficulty rating of the trail.</p>

                <img class="tech-trail-img" src="images/Page 3 Tech Trail.jpg" alt="Technical Trail Image">
                <p>Technical trails are usually slower and are meant to test the riders control and ability to manouver the bike. 
                    They consist of rocky, steep and rutty terrain with a focus on control rather than speed. Just like flow trails, 
                    the amount of steep features and technical sections depends on the difficulty rating on the trail. Green trails typicaly 
                    arnt classified as technical.</p>

                <p>There are many other trail attrbutes such as "downhill only","connector trail","singletrack","fireroad" and they all vary based
                    on the trail system you are riding in. This is why its important to read the trail map as they will usually have a key that will tell
                    you what the terms mean because they vary from system to system.</p>
